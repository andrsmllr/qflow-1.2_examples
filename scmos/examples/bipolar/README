SCMOS rules for vertical NPN transistor has been revised from version
6 to 7 due to the requirement to support ORBIT 1.2 micron process.

If you use the "scmos" technology to load the cell "npn_array.mag",
you'll find the following DRCs:

N-well overlap of collector must be at least 3 (MOSIS rule #16.11)
Pbase overlap of base contact must be at least 3 (MOSIS rule #16.5)

The cell "npn_array.mag" is the actual test vehicle for the ORBIT
2.0 micron process, so it should work OK if you target for that
process. It is included here (without modification) to illustrate the 
difference between thees processes.

All other cells have been modified according to the latest SCMOS DRC
rules - revision 7. Please send attention e-mail to mosis@mosis.edu
if you have any problem or comments...
