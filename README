Examples for the open source digital synthesis flow Qflow 1.2.

How to get started:

Installation on Ubuntu (16.04 LTS or later):
For Ubuntu (and possibly other Debian-based distributions) the default package
repository contains packages for very conveniant installation of qflow.
Running install.sh will install all required packages directly from
the package repository.
The techonolgy files for the osu035 process will also be installed by default.

Installation on other Linux distribution:
This repository contains all dependencies for the Qflow open source digital
synthesis flow in the ./sw folder as git submodules.
Please go through each of the folders under ./sw and follow the respective
installation instructions.

After you have finished installation you can go to ./examples to get down to
business. There are several examples trying to showcase the basic features of
Qflow in very simple steps.
