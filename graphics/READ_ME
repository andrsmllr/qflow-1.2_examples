	Overall organization of Magic's graphics directory

In this directory are files to allow Magic to write to a display, going
directly to the frame buffer or instead to a window package such as X.

For each display supported, there is a driver contained in the files
grXXX1.c through grXXX5.c, and grXXXInt.h.  The .c files contain
the code for the driver, and basically just include implementations of
routines listed in graphics.h.  The grXXXInt.h file contains internal 
(thus the "Int") definitions used by the driver.

Each driver is given a unique prefix.  "Aed" is used for Aed displays,
"SunW" is used for the Sun window system driver, and "X11" is given
for the X11 window system.  Multiple drivers can be created, for instance
you could have "X11a" and "X11b" drivers.  A table near the start of
grMain.c shows which drivers are available, and how they map to the 
"-d" option on Magic's command line.  The Makefile must be updated, of
course, to include the .o files for whatever drivers you wish to include.
