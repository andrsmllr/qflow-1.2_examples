When adjusting crossings involving river-routing tiles, be certain
    to handle case where we go through several river-routing tiles
    in a row (can happen even if river-routing channels aren't adjacent,
    such as when density reaches its maximum in a normal channel that
    is next to a river-routing channel).
Look at expansion from destination at same time as from starting points.
