INTRODUCTION

  This officail MOSIS SCMOS technology release consists a famaly of
  SCMOS technology files for Magic version 6.4.4 (available from
  anonymous FTP gatekeeper.dec.com):

   * "scmos"      - standard SCMOS technology for MOSIS process with
	            minimum feature length larger than 1.5 micron.
		    ORBIT 2.0 micron analog, ORBIT 1.2 micron processes
		    are supported.
   * "scmos-tm"   - SCMOS technology with tighter metal spacing rules
		    for metal1 and metal2.
		    HP-CMOS34, HP-CMOS26B (lambda=0.5 micron) and
		    HP-CMOS14B (lambda=0.35 micron) processes are
		    supported.
   * "scmos-sub"  - SCMOS technology for HP's sub-micron CMOS processes.
		    HP-CMOS26G (lambda=0.40 micron) and CMOS14B
		    (lambda=0.30 micron) processes are supported.
   * "scmos-ibm"  - SCMOS technology for IBM CMSX-2185 process.
                    (not supported anymore, but it's there in case...)

  To invoke Magic with appropriate technology selection, you need to
  use the '-T' command option. For example, the command

     "magic -Tscmos-sub"

  start Magic with "scmos-sub" designated for HP's submicron processes.

  MOSIS's distribution of Magic technolofy file for SCMOS technology
  now has CIFinput and CIFoutput section in templates so that it will
  be easier to maintain. It also supports two layers, "open" and
  "pstop" for micro-machined design fabrication in CMOS process as 
  described by Janet C. Marshall's paper in IEEE Circuit and Devices,
  Vol. 8, N0. 6, 1992. this layer is now in a 'preliminary' stage.
 
  Before installation, please read the file 'COPYRIGHT' for copyright
  notice.

INSTALLATION

  Please install the latest release of Magic (version 6.4.4) available
  from anonymous FTP gatekeeper.dec.com.

  To generate all technology files, simply type

     "make" if your are using Magic 6.4.x, or

     "make version3" if your are using Magic 6.3.x

  To install all technology files into the standard ~cad library, just type

     "make install"

  to you system (Unix) prompt. You might want to check the path for
  standard ~cad/lib/magic/lib first before you do this...

IRSIM PARAMETERS

  Parameter files of various MOSIS supported process  for IRSIM
  switch-level simulator can be found under the sub-directory
  "irsim_parameters".

DOCUMENTATION

  Please read the file UPDATE for the lates update information...

  In the doc subdirectory, you can find a preliminary PostScript file
  for MOSIS's SCMOS Technology Manual. Warning: This manualscript is
  in a very preliminary stage, if you have any problem with it don't
  hesitate to discuss it further with me...(pi@isi.edu)

EXAMPLE

  In the 'examples' subdirectory, we have:

  palette.mag - palette of all layers available in MOSIS's SCMOS tech-
	nology". Turn your DRC off before viewing it!!

  ccd.mag - An example of a buried channel CCD layout.

  float_gate.mag - An example of a floating-gate device.

  wellcap.mag - An example of layout of linear capacitors available
	from SCNLC technology, i.e. HP's 1.2um process.

  npn.mag - An example of a Bipolar NPN transistor layout. For ORBIT's
	2um lower-noise Analog process.

  large_npn.mag - A large NPN bipolar transistor consists of smalls
	unit transistors.

  all.mag - An example of part of the design rules... NOT Complete...

  m3padframe.mag - A TinyChip padframe for HP's 1.0um process. Notice
	that those m1 strip is required to complete a DRC free pad.
	These pads use all three metal layers.

  inf_source - An example of micromachined device fabrication. This
        layout is a reproduction of Fig. 8 of Janet C. Marshall's
	article titled "High Level Melds Micromachined Devices with
	Foundries", IEEE Circuits and Devices, Vol. 8, No. 6, pp.
	10-17, Nov. 1992. A complete NIST MEMS library is also
        available from MOSIS's anonymous FTP archive.
