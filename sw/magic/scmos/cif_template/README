This directory contains template files for MOSIS's SCMOS technology
for Magic layout editor.

A simple command "make" should be able to generate all appropriate
files needed. You can also use "make clean" to remove all files and
then "make all" to generate all-style files.

After all CIF input/output styles has been generated, you'll have to
go to the scmos directory to 're-make' the SCMOS technology file.

Gook luck,
