Description: Multi-level, over-the-cell maze router
 Qrouter is a tool to generate metal layers and vias to physically connect
 together a netlist in a VLSI fabrication technology. It is a maze router,
 otherwise known as an "over-the-cell" router or "sea-of-gates" router. That
 is, unlike a channel router, it begins with a description of placed standard
 cells, usually packed together at minimum spacing, and places metal routes
 over the standard cells.
 .
 Qrouter uses the open standard LEF and DEF formats as file input and output.
 It takes the cell definitions from a LEF file, and analyzes the geometry for
 each cell to determine contact points and route obstructions. It then reads
 the cell placement, pin placement, and netlist from a DEF file, performs the
 detailed route, and writes an annotated DEF file as output.
