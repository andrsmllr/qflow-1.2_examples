I. Bugs to fix (also in magic-7.5 [stable]):

  1. The "extresist" code only recognizes original "fet" types, not
     the new "device" types in the extract file.

  2. "plow" has been broken for some time.  It should derive its rules
     from the DRC decks (using the new routines that are meant for just
     that sort of thing).
